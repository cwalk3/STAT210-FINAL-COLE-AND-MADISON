## loading packages & dataset
```{r message = F}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidymodels)
library(readxl)
soccer <- read_excel("AllTimeRankingByClub.xlsx")
```

#### Introduction and data

## Data Cleaning
```{r}
soccer = soccer %>%
  rename(goals_for = `Goals For`,
         goals_against = `Goals Against`,
         goal_diff = `Goal Diff`)

soccer = soccer %>%
  mutate(winspermatch = Win/Played,
         pointspermatch = Pts/Played,
         goalspermatch = goals_for/Played,
         goalsagainstpermatch = goals_against/Played,
         goalmarginpermatch = goal_diff/Played)
```

## EDA

Plot 1: 
```{r}
soccer %>%
  filter(Titles > 0) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(Club, (-Titles)), y = Titles)) +
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity') +
  labs(x = 'Club', y = 'Number of Titles', title = 'Number of Titles for each Club',
       subtitle = 'Excluding Clubs That Have Never Won a Title') +
  theme_bw() +
  scale_x_discrete(guide = guide_axis(angle = 45))
```

Plot 2:
```{r}
soccer %>%
  filter(Titles > 0) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(Country, (-Titles)), y = Titles)) +
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity') +
  labs(x = 'Country', y = 'Number of Titles', title = 'Number of Titles per Country',
       subtitle = 'Excluding Clubs That Have Never Won a Title') +
  theme_bw() +
  scale_x_discrete(guide = guide_axis(angle = 45))
```

Plot 3:
```{r warnings = F}
ggplot(data = soccer, aes(x = winspermatch, y = goalmargin)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm', se = F, color = 'midnightblue') +
  #geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color = 'red') +
  labs(x = "Win Percentage", y = 'Goal Margin per Match', 
       title = 'Number of Wins in Tournament vs Goal Differential') +
  theme_bw()
```
